<!--
Self-replicating, self-ordering log of actions shared between all clients.
Using the power behind redux's hot reloading and time travel, your client
dispatches actions itself and so does every other client, they share the state,
and it all just works.

## scuttlebutt

Efficient peer to peer reconciliation. We use it as the underlying
protocol to share dispatched redux actions among peers, and eventually agree on
their order in time. As actions from the past arrive, we replay history as if
they had always existed.

A sample "server" peer is included, which might sync changes to a database,
write a persistent log, or manage system/world/NPC actors.

While it works great in a client-server set up, you could upgrade/downgrade to
peer-to-peer connections, or go offline, and changes sync when you next connect.

Note, scuttlebutt does not make any guarantees of security or identity. Peer
`Bob` is free to lie to `Jane` about `Amy`'s actions. A client-server layout can
mitigate this risk, and WebSockets over SSL mitigates MITM replacement, but as
the project matures this will be brought into consideration.

[Scuttlebutt paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/flowgossip.pdf).

## dispatcher

`Dispatcher` is our Scuttlebutt model. It handles remote syncing of local
actions, local dispatching of remote actions, and altering action history
(rolling back to past checkpoints and replaying actions) as required.

## Redux store enhancer

Our default export is the store enhancer. You use it like this:

```js
// configureStore.js

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'

import rootReducer from '../reducers'
import scuttlebutt from 'redux-scuttlebutt'

export default (initialState) => {
  return createStore(rootReducer, initialState, scuttlebutt({
    uri: 'http://localhost:3000',
  }))
}

```

It wraps your store's root reducer (to store history), `getState` (to return the
current state in history) and `dispatch` (to connect to peers).

## conflict-free reducers

While `redux-scuttlebutt` facilitates action sharing and enhancing the store,
it's the responsiblity of the app's reducers to apply actions. Overall your app
must be strictly pure, without side effects or non-deterministic mutations.

In a complex real-time multi-user app, this is easier said than done. Some
strategies may be,

* Avoid preconditions. The Game Of Life example only dispatches TOGGLE and STEP.
  Neither have preconditions, there's no "illegal" way to dispatch them, and
  they'll always successfully mutate state.
* Only allow peers (action sources) control over their own domain (entity). An
  entity might request something of another entity, which that entity would then
  dispatch its own action to mutate its own domain.
* Implement a Conflict-free data type, which only allows certain operations in
  exchange for never conflicting.

## example

Examples are found under `examples/`.

<!--
You may have to `npm link` your redux-scuttlebutt directory and `npm link redux-
scuttlebutt` your example project directory during development.
-->

* `counter`:
  [redux counter example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter)
  with the addition of redux-scuttlebutt.
* `chat`: A very basic chat application.
* `grrowl/redux-game-of-life-scuttlebutt`:
  [Conway's Game Of Life](https://github.com/grrowl/redux-game-of-life-scuttlebutt)
  multiplayer edition.

## roadmap

one of:

* add encryption over the top of our existing scuttlebutt library
  * is it as simple as extra pipeing through encrypt/decrypt
* use a different implementation
  * simple-scuttlebutt is maybe better but wraps it up in a state-based model.
    unfortunate.

* batch updates which come in "at once"
  * ala <https://github.com/tappleby/redux-batched-subscribe>
* garbage collect update and state history beyond the "event horizon" of known
  source timestamps. New peers would need a state snapshot.
  * requires snapshot sharing, extending scuttlebutt protocol.
* recover when invalid actions sequences occur
  * we currently overwrite history during replay and don't handle recovery of
    error.
* allow pluggable socket library/transport
* tests
  * simulate a multi-hop distributed network with delay, ensure consistency
  * ensure rewind/reordering works
  * ensure API
* more example applications! something real-time, event driven.
* gossip `_updates` in timestamp order instead of FIFO order
  * more efficient replaying, better conformity with the protocol.

## contributions

Contributions very welcomed. **This project is still in its very early,
experimental stages.**

A major aim of this project is to be able to drop this middleware into an
existing, compatible project and have it "just work". Additional features
(timestamp strategy, streams and encryption) should be configurable in
redux-scuttlebutt itself without messing with the redux application's
structure/actions/reducers

## licence

MIT. Without open source projects like React, Redux, Scuttlebutt, and all the
amazing technology which has been an inspiration for this project, many
wonderful things in this world wouldn't exist.
